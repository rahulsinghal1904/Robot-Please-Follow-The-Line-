Reflective Sensors – Detects track edges

Motors & Motor Drivers – Enables movement and steering

Custom PCB – Houses sensor circuits

Chassis & Mechanical Design – 3D-modeled structure for stability

🌟 Algorithm & Implementation

1️⃣ Distance Calculation Algorithm

Implemented in C++ (distancecalc.cpp) to track movement with high precision.Formula used:

Distance = (Encoder Count * Wheel Circumference) / Pulses per Revolution;

Ensures accurate tracking of movement, crucial for performance analysis.

2️⃣ PID Controller for Line Following

A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller dynamically adjusts motor speeds based on sensor feedback.

PID Components:

Proportional (P) – Corrects based on how far the robot is from the center.

Integral (I) – Accumulates past errors to correct drift.

Derivative (D) – Predicts and smooths future movement.

PID Algorithm (Implemented in FinalCode)

The PID function runs continuously, ensuring real-time course correction.

Optimized Kp, Ki, and Kd values for stability.

3️⃣ Motor & Sensor Integration

Developed motor control functions for speed adjustments, turning, and stopping.

Integrated sensor feedback to guide movement.
